This is my baseline solution for the U.S. Patent Phrase to Phrase Matching competition. https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/us-patent-phrase-to-phrase-matching/ 

The rest of the code will be written in private repository and publicly available after the competition.

```python crossvalidation_train.py -C dummy_config```

or ``` python crossvalidation_train.py -C dummy_config -WB``` if you are logged into Weghits and Biases and want to track your experiments.
